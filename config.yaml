# Common Settings
MAX_TOKENS: 4096  # Increased for qwen3-vl:4b thinking mode (model needs space for internal reasoning + final answer)
TEMPERATURE: 0.0  # The temperature of the model: the lower the value, the more consistent the output of the model
REQUEST_INTERVAL: 10  # Time in seconds between consecutive requests

# Android Configuration
